## Tutorials
The tutorials will provide basic insight on how to code in CLIPS, by defining facts, rules, and the like. The knowledge will then be applied to patterns and actions, where the idea of creating objects is similar in the object-oriented programming paradigm. Wildcard patterns will follow suit, a way to accept input and parse data. Templates as well as conditions will implement concepts that are similar to abstract classes.  

The tutorials are all kept in the [Tutorials](../master/Tutorials) folder.
